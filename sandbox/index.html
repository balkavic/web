            I got a job offer from Nokia (HERE) Berlin in October 2013. I moved to Berlin in December 2013 and I joined HERE in January 2014. My first role was a (junior) test automation engineer.
I started working on a CI system that compiled a software called MOS, a layer between map data and API level, and ran automated (unit and integration) tests.
My role was primarily to maintain the CI system (Jenkins), the infrastructure (servers + nodes) and provide support to the RnD teams in case of failures.

            As the company was ramping up the usage of cloud infrastructure in their CI / CD systems, I was assigned with a task of finding a cloud solution that can replace on-site physical devices in mobile (Android + iOS) testing.
I evaluated the offering of different third-party vendors, and after the decision was made, I started started working with the selected Provider on setting up our current tests with their solution.
At this point it was a 1-man project, and the work involved constant alignment with the Provider and our RnD teams, and developing an integration framework that can be used in our existing CI system.

            As more and more RnD teams got on-boarded to this cloud solution, we had to extend the team.
In 2016 a dedicated Product Owner was added to the project. In 2017 we added two engineers to take care of the increasing amount of support work and of the improvement of the integration framework.
Slowly, my role shifted from technical work to communication + managing team work.

            In September 2019 I applied to an internal job opening of Scrum Master / Agile Coach. After a successful interview I accepted the new role and in October 2019 I started working as a full-time agile coach with the HERE SDK team.
SDK team is a team of 50 people, organized in 6 sub-teams (squads). Step by step, I got involved in their day-to-day work, meetings, discussions. I started to organize their Agile ceremonies and provide coaching on team-level and to individuals.
